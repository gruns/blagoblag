=============

The weird IRC channel named after me has gotten pretty big. There's many
people in it that I've never met.

Thus far the rules have been kept pretty loose, tending more towards
self-moderation. That's not a strategy that scales, and in light of several
recent conversations, we're going to have some more explicit rules.

These rules are not all encompassing. If you see something that violates them,
or otherwise makes you uncomfortable, please message me (``Alex_Gaynor``). If
you're not comfortable messaging me, please message someone else (TODO: make a
list of other folks), they'll whack me over the head.

If you have any feedback on these rules, please bring it up in
``##alex_gaynor``, note however, that I might ask you to move the discussion
to private message if I think it's likely to be disruptive.

Rules
-----

This isn't a channel for 101-work on feminism. We're more than happy to
provide links to resources, but this channel isn't the right place for
extended 101-education. If you find yourself on the `Ally Bingo card`_ you've
gone in the wrong direction.

The channel *will* feature discussions on issues of toxic culture in software,
and how to improve things. Do not confuse this with an opportunity to defend
the status quo.

Sexism, racism, homophobia, or other forms of discriminatory language are not
tolerated.

In general, the `Computer Anonymous`_ rules are a good starting point.
